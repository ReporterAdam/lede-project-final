Hello all, 

This is an attempt by me (Adam Friedman) to build a campaign finance donation database that can be used for internal searching purposes. 

In this file are csvs files downloaded and compiled from the Tennessee Registry of Election Finance website. The organizations campaign finance search (https://apps.tn.gov/tncamp/) is not very good.

The state election finance website is not easily accessible, has weird search and name parameters, and doesn't allow users to see multiple years at a time

# What I did

I've cleaned up these csvs by referencing them to other data sources. I've tied mysterious PACs to names of companies. I've tied politicians to their pacs (or inagural funds) for donation purposes.

I've also linked candidates to the result of their races, city, political party and whether they are an currently elected official. 

The website is crude, only searchable by politician name. I hope to update and make this better. 

I'm calling these a prototype "Adam Tennessee Campaign Finance Database v1.0"
